Visual Studio Code generates
a launch.json with almost all of the required information.
To get started with debugging you need to fill in the program
field with the path to the executable you plan to debug.
This must be specified for both the launch and attach
(if you plan to attach to a running instance at any point)
configurations.
The generated file contains two sections, one that
configures debugging for launch and a second that configures debugging for attach.
